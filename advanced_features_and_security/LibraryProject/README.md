# 📚 LibraryProject

## 🎯 Objective

Gain familiarity with Django by setting up a Django development environment and creating a basic Django project.  
This task introduces you to the workflow of Django projects, including project creation, running the development server, and understanding the default project structure.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Steps

### ✅ 1. Install Django

Make sure Python is installed on your system.  
Then, install Django using pip:

```bash
pip install django
✅ 2. Create a New Django Project
Create a new Django project named LibraryProject:


django-admin startproject LibraryProject
✅ 3. Navigate to the Project Directory

cd LibraryProject
✅ 4. Create README.md
Create this README file inside the LibraryProject directory.
This file serves as documentation for your project setup and structure.

✅ 5. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:


python manage.py runserver
Then open your browser and go to:


http://127.0.0.1:8000/
You should see the default Django welcome page, which means your project is working successfully.

🗂️ Project Structure Overview
After running startproject, the following structure will be created:


LibraryProject/
├── LibraryProject/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── manage.py
└── README.md
📄 Key Files and Their Roles
manage.py: Command-line utility to interact with this Django project (runserver, migrations, etc.).

LibraryProject/ (inner folder):

init.py: Marks this directory as a Python package.

settings.py: Contains all project configuration (apps, databases, middleware, etc.).

urls.py: Defines URL routing — acts as the table of contents for your project.

asgi.py / wsgi.py: Entry points for ASGI/WSGI-compatible web servers.

🚀 Next Steps
Create Django apps within the project (e.g., book catalog, user management).

Learn about models, views, templates, and the admin interface.

Implement your own custom features and push updates to your GitHub repository.

Explore deploying your Django project in a production environment.

# Django Permissions and Groups Setup

### Custom Permissions
Defined in `Book` model:
- `can_view` – View book entries
- `can_create` – Create new books
- `can_edit` – Edit existing books
- `can_delete` – Delete books

### Groups
- **Viewers**: Only `can_view`
- **Editors**: `can_view`, `can_create`, `can_edit`
- **Admins**: All permissions

### Views & Access Control
Views are protected using `@permission_required`:
- `book_list` → `can_view`
- `book_create` → `can_create`
- `book_edit` → `can_edit`
- `book_delete` → `can_delete`

### How to Set Up
Run this inside `python manage.py shell`:

```python
from bookshelf.permissions_setup import setup_groups_and_permissions
setup_groups_and_permissions()
